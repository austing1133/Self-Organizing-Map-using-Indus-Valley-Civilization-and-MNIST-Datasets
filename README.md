Self-Organizing Map using Indus Valley Civilization and MNIST Datasets

SOM_V1 uses the MNIST Dataset to create a self-organizing map. The map shows topographical features of the data and to some extent can be measured for accuracy however this is not the true goal and intended purpose of a SOM.

SOM_V2 uses a Indus Valley Civilization character set provided by the professor of an Artificial Intelligence course at Florida Tech. Unfortunately I cannot make the data availiable.
